When Peppa walked into her garden this morning to water her flowers as usual, she found an egg as big as a basketball in the mud. The egg is golden and decorated with delicate patterns. Peppa was so excited. She believed that she would get rich out of this. She rolled the gaint egg to her house, putting in next to her fireplace.
Every day Peppa would check on the egg, but nothing happened, until one night. That night, with the full moon shining overhead, the egg cracked.
