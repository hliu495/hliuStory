When Peppa walked into her garden this morning to water her flowers as usual, she found an egg as big as a basketball in the mud. The egg is golden and decorated with delicate patterns. Peppa was so excited. She believed that she would get rich out of this. She rolled the gaint egg to her house, putting in next to her fireplace.
Every day Peppa would check on the egg, but nothing happened, until one night. That night, with the full moon shining overhead, the egg cracked.
Emerging from the egg was a red skinned dragon. Its ruby skin glistened against the running fire, seeming to feed on the warmth. 
Peppa was astonished to see the giant creature. Since, she had so carefully taken care of the egg and the dragon, the dragon was harmless to her. Later, the dragon protected her for the rest of her life and lived happily.
Years later, Peppa was too old to look after her dragon. She held her best friend and cried. Suddenly, the dragon carried her to the sky. They disappeared ever since.
